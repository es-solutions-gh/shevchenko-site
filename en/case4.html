      <h2>ü¶æ Case Study: Winning in Post-COVID Retail (Ukraine, 2021)</h2>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>In the aftermath of COVID-19, a leading brewing company in Ukraine - part of a major global group - not only survived repeated lockdowns but emerged stronger. Despite closures in HoReCa, the company maintained its #1 market position, increased profit, and safeguarded 1,300 jobs across three modern breweries. The retail landscape, however, had been transformed: modern trade surged to over 50% of the company‚Äôs business (up from 40% pre-pandemic), demanding a fundamental shift in strategy.</p>

      <h3>Challenge: Swimming with Whales</h3>
      <p>The shift towards modern trade exposed structural weaknesses:</p>
      <p>1. Volatile performance in modern formats, heavily dependent on deep price promotions.</p>
      <p>2. Strongholds in the east and west underrepresented in nationwide assortment matrices of retail chains.</p>
      <p>3. Poor in-store execution and a sales team structure misaligned with new realities.</p>
      <p>4. Service levels lagging behind top FMCG peers; logistics failing to meet customer expectations.</p>
      <p>5. Retailers leveraging increased bargaining power to demand deeper discounts and longer credit - eroding profitability.</p>
      <p>6. Intensified competition triggered a destructive 'promo spiral', where discounts moved share without growing the category.</p>

      <h3>Approach: Fix the Fundamentals and Harness AI</h3>
      <p><strong>My Role:</strong> CEO, reporting to the EVP Eastern Europe.</p>
      <p>Recognizing that this was a business-critical transformation, I mobilized cross-functional teams across Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, Finance, and IT. Our strategy combined back-to-basics discipline with technology-driven innovation:</p>
      <p>1. Organizational reset: Shifted from geographic to customer-centric structure, revised segmentation by profitability, and re-engineered trade terms to stop financial leakage.</p>
      <p>2. Service level upgrade: Built cross-functional account teams, giving Supply Chain and Finance direct customer-facing KPIs for satisfaction.</p>
      <p>3. Promo strategy overhaul: Increased promo pressure from 35% to 42% of turnover, with focus on profitable SKUs and tailored customer needs, regaining in-store visibility without margin collapse.</p>
      <p>4. AI-powered execution: Deployed machine learning image recognition (95% accuracy) via 580 field merchandisers, providing real-time insights on shelf presence, pricing, and out-of-stocks. Incentives were tied to objective AI data.</p>

      <h3>Results: From Vulnerability to Strength</h3>
      <p>1. Closed the market share gap to competitors in modern trade, achieving a solid #2 position.</p>
      <p>2. Eliminated all loss-making customer accounts; restored profitability to breakeven or above.</p>
      <p>3. Ranked #1 preferred supplier among all beverage producers by the independent ‚ÄúAdvantage‚Äù agency - across sales, marketing, logistics, and product quality.</p>
      <p>4. AI adoption delivered unprecedented visibility, agility, and precision in execution.</p>

      <h3>Strategic Takeaways</h3>
      <p>‚Äì Resilient companies don‚Äôt just survive disruption - they reshape around new market realities.</p>
      <p>‚Äì Cross-functional integration is as critical as commercial strategy in modern trade.</p>
      <p>‚Äì Smart use of AI can turn execution into a competitive weapon, not just a hygiene factor.</p>
      <p>‚Äì Protecting profitability requires courage to reset terms and resist unsustainable demands.</p>

      <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
      <p>This case proved that disruption - whether from a pandemic or retail consolidation - can be an accelerator of transformation. By fixing fundamentals, mobilizing cross-functional discipline, and pioneering AI in retail execution, I transformed modern trade from the company‚Äôs weakest channel into a platform for long-term growth. It stands as evidence that even in crisis, strategic clarity and innovation can turn vulnerability into strength.</p>
