      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>When Carlsberg‚Äôs Baltic Beverages Holding acquired Zolotoy Ural brewery in 2001, it was a struggling Soviet-style operation with outdated processes, weak brand portfolio, and declining sales. In two years, we turned it into the fastest-growing regional brewery in Russia, achieving 72% sales growth, regional market share increase from 3.6% to 8.2%, and 3√ó profit growth.</p>

      <h3>Challenge: A Brewery in Decline</h3>
      <p>1. Outdated brand portfolio and lack of marketing discipline.</p>
      <p>2. A stagnant distributor network with low motivation and little coverage, distribution limited to 3.7m people home sub-region.</p>
      <p>3. Weak brand image in a region of 29.5 million consumers.</p>
      <p>4. Internal culture resistant to change and dominated by legacy mindsets.</p>
      <p>The business urgently needed a full-scale commercial turnaround to survive and compete.</p>

      <h3>Approach: Driving a Commercial Turnaround</h3>
      <p><strong>My Role:</strong> Sales Director, reporting to the CEO.</p>
      <p>I led the transformation from the sales side by focusing on people, processes, quality of in-store execution and distribution building. Key initiatives included:</p>
      <p>1. Executing re-launch of the key brand set to just 2 weeks after my arrival by quickly deploying sales fundamentals, incentives and target-setting.</p>
      <p>2. Building a high-performance team ‚Äì recruited managers from Coca-Cola, P&G, and other FMCG leaders; implemented KPIs and accountability.</p>
      <p>3. Rebuilding distribution ‚Äì partnered with top-performing distributors, introduced service quality metrics, and opened 9 regional offices to expand coverage.</p>
      <p>4. Introducing value-management with assortment, discounts, and sales CAPEX effectiveness tools.</p>
      <p>5. Strengthening corporate culture ‚Äì removed underperformers, promoted merit-based growth, and set a new standard of professionalism.</p>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>1. +72% sales growth in the first year of transformation.</p>
      <p>2. Market share increased from 3.6% to 8.2% in two years (x2.3), according to the Business Analytica agency.</p>
      <p>3. Profit tripled within two years.</p>
      <p>4. Awarded ‚ÄúAmber Star‚Äù by the Russian Union of Brewers for fastest growth.</p>
      <p>5. Uralsky Master brand became #6 in 29.5 million people region and a showcase asset for the Carlsberg Group.</p>

      <h3>Strategic Takeaways</h3>
      <p>- <strong>Start with people:</strong> a strong team accelerates transformation.</p>
      <p>- <strong>Quick wins + long-term strategy:</strong> combine immediate sales boosts with structural change.</p>
      <p>- <strong>No "sacred cows":</strong> decisive leadership (removing underperformers, investing in bold moves) is essential in turnaround.</p>
      <p>- <strong>Culture matters:</strong> shifting mindsets was as important as improving processes.</p>

      <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
      <p>This case illustrates how disciplined leadership, modern marketing, and cultural transformation can revive even a legacy business under extreme pressure.</p>
